                 <b><u>you shouldn't need to handle it on your own.</u></b>
            </b>
            <p>
                For that exact reason, this project was
                started to help wherever we can, by 
                developing the preventative care tools,
                you couldn't even dream someone will 
                make for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you're seeing this, hundred of hours
                have been spent in developing the 
                tools below.

                Now, Its time to scroll down, and

            <p>One of the main ways of slowing down the disease's progression, is by reducing
                sugar and starch intake as much as possible. To make it much easier, tens,
                or maybe even hundreds of hours were
                put into researching the nutrtional values of many, <i>many</i> different day to day items,
                and compiling them into a list.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tool is, basically, a very long list of foods, with their sugar and carbohydrate contents
                attached, as well as their glycemic index, and glycemic load, with the latter being the 
                most important, and (of course) somewhat rare piece of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                To improve the tool and the traction it gets, it has a nice content contribution feature:
                you can request/provide foods you want to be added to the list - and if they're added,
                you can get on the content contribution leaderboards, and with enough content
                contributions, even reach first place ðŸ˜‰ 
            </p>
            <p>
                As of writing this, it already contains about 200(!) 
                different items, with many more on the way :)
