            <step>
                <content>Pour the water into a pot, and add the salt. Start boiling the water.</content>
            </step>
            <step>
                <content>Add the pasta to the boiling water, and wait 4 minutes. (We're cooking the pasta for a total of 5 minutes.)</content>
            </step>
            <step>
                <content>Take 3/4 cups pasta water from the boiling, and keep aside. Cool as much as possible, if possible.</content>
                <note>You can take as much pasta water as your'e comfortable with. Just make sure you have more than 3/4 cups.</note>
            </step>
            <step>
                <content>Wait until the pasta reaches 5 minutes in water. Then, dump the pasta into a strainer.</content>
                <note>Leaving the pasta in the water can cause it to get mushy.</note>
            </step>
            <step>
                <content>Then, to a pan (or the same pot, if you prefer, since the pot is now empty) add the olive oil. Wait for it to heat up, and then add the pesto sauce, pasta water and parmesan cheese to the pan.</content>
            </step>
            <step>
                <content>Quickly mix the sauce until it reaches a texture similar to that of pink sauce</content>
                <note>If the sauch is too watery, keep stirring the sauce. It will gradually reduce it.</note>
            </step>
            <step>
                <content>Add the pasta to the sauce, and mix it well. Enjoy your pasta! :)</content>
                <note>To make the pasta healthier to eat, refrigirate it - when reheated, some of the starch will become resistent, and will behave like fiber.</note>
