        <h1>How This Website Confirms Data</h1>
        <p>One of the main drives to creating a concentrated website for this, instead of relying on some documents/external lists,
            is the shear amount of inconsistent, wildly inaccurate, and sometimes, even malicious data. (I've seen more than a handful of websites
            trying to seem legitimate while wildly exaggerating the 'healthiness' of certain products they sell..)<br>
            Since i don't want to be even near the same category as some of these website, i decided to be fully transparent as to where
            i get my data, and even open-source the website (meaning the website's code is publicly viewable). </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p '="">Before we begin, it's important to remember, that even with the efforts i take to validate data, some may still be innacurate. 
                As mentioned in the website's about section, and in it's license, i am not liable for anything that may be caused by this website.

        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <p>
            </p><section>As of today, the database takes data from 3 different sources:</section>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><a href="https://www.usda.gov/">USDA</a> - Most of the data about "Raw" things, from vegetables &amp; spices to meat, is from this source. 
                        In cases where data is taken from here, Glycemic indices &amp; Glycemic loads are taken from The website 
                        <a href="https://glycemic-index.net/">Glycemic Index Guide</a>, which inherits from the USDA as well.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.foodsdictionary.co.il/">foodsdictionary.co.il</a> - In cases where details differ massively between sources, or the USDA doesn't provide
                        enough/any data, this website is used to fill in the gaps. It also reports accurate data.</li>
                <li><a href="https://foodstruct.com">foodstruct.com</a> - The websites mentioned above don't have any data on common branded items, such as famous fast-food chains
                        and drinks. In these cases, data is taken from this website, as it seems to be accurate.</li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>When the website adds data, it uses these sources as much as it possibly can, and even drops data where there isn't any which is trusted.</p>

        <h2>How Users Provide Data</h2>
        <p>When a user makes a contribution, it automatically writes "potential" code for the website, and alerts me of a request to 
            write this code to the website. <br>
            I Go over the data, and see if it is supported in any of the trusted sources, if available.
            If not - I try to look for data in other sources, to see if they support the request's data.</p>
        <p>If the data is supported, I manually allow the data to be merged into the website (may sound complicated, takes basically two clicks ðŸ˜…),
            update the leaderboards (if the user who provided the data gave their name) and the website online is updated.</p>
        <p>If the data is partially supported, i fix what needs fixing, and do the steps above.</p>
        <p>If the data is not supported, I reject the request to add the code to the website, and instead i add the food to a 'backlist', which i research on my own.</p>
        <h2>Different Identifiers</h2>
        <p>You may have noticed some cells in the database contain some extra information, 
            in the form of additional signs/replacement words.
            These are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>~</code> - <span>One of Two reasons:</span>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>The food contains a very broad range of data, and the most supported &amp; common value was chosen</li>
                    <li>A source other than the USDA (or any of website's other trusted sources) was used because of a lack of data (The website's reliability was still checked).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>&lt;</code> - <span>There is no accurately averageable data, but there is a "clear" upper bound for it.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>&gt;</code> - <span>Same as <code>&lt;</code>, but the other way around, where there's a clear lower bound.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code style="color: red; font-weight: 900;">âš </code> - <span>Despite the food's details making it looks good to eat, they're not
                     showing the full picture, and they're actually harmful. When displayed on a detail, the entire detail is
                      colored red, and when clicked/tapped a box of text will show up to explain why the food is harmful.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>No Data</code> - <span>No reliable data was found for this food item. Important to note -
                    Even if one column has no data, that doesnt necessarily mean that the other columns have innacurate/estimated data. If they do, a <code>~</code> is used.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
