        <h1>How This Website Confirms Data</h1>
        <p>One of the main drives to creating a concentrated website for this, instead of relying on some documents/external lists,
            is the shear amount of inconsistent, wildly inaccurate, and sometimes, even malicious data. (I've seen more than a handful of websites
            trying to seem legitimate while wildly exaggerating the 'healthiness' of certain products they sell..)<br>
            Since i don't want to be even near the same category as some of these website, i decided to be fully transparent as to where
            i get my data, and even open-source the website (meaning the website's code is publicly viewable). </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p '="">Before we begin, it's important to remember, that even with the efforts i take to validate data, some may still be innacurate. 
                As mentioned in the website's about section, and in it's license, i am not liable for anything that may be caused by this website.

        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <p>
            </p><section>As of today, the database takes data from 2 different sources:</section>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><a href="https://www.usda.gov/">USDA</a> - Most of the data about "Raw" things, from vegetables &amp; spices to meat, is from this source. 
                        In cases where data is taken from here, Glycemic indices &amp; Glycemic loads are taken from The website 
                        <a href="https://glycemic-index.net/">Glycemic Index Guide</a>, which inherits from the USDA as well.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.foodsdictionary.co.il/">foodsdictionary.co.il</a> - In cases where details differ massively between sources, or the USDA doesn't provide
                        enough/any data, this website is used to fill in the gaps. It also reports accurate data.</li>
                <li><a href="https://foodstruct.com">foodstruct.com</a> - The websites mentioned above don't have any data on common branded items, such as famous fast-food chains
                        and drinks. In these cases, data is taken from this website, as it seems to be accurate.</li>
            </ul>
